# Maybe: Open-source personal finance app

<b>Get involved: [Discord](https://link.maybe.co/discord) â€¢ [Website](https://maybe.co) â€¢ [Issues](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/issues)</b>

ðŸš¨ NOTE: This is the original React app of the previously-defunct personal finance app, Maybe. This original version used many external services (Plaid, Finicity, etc) and getting it to fully function will be a decent amount of work.

There's a LOT of work to do to get this functioning, but it should be feasible.

## Backstory

We spent the better part of 2021/2022 building a personal finance + wealth management app called Maybe. Very full-featured, including an "Ask an Advisor" feature which connected users with an actual CFP/CFA to help them with their finances (all included in your subscription).

The business end of things didn't work out and so we shut things down mid-2023.

We spent the better part of $1,000,000 building the app (employees + contractors, data providers/services, infrastructure, etc).

We're now reviving the product as a fully open-source project. The goal is to let you run the app yourself, for free, and use it to manage your own finances and eventually offer a hosted version of the app for a small monthly fee.

## End goal

Ultimately we want to rebuild this so that you can self-host, but we also have plans to offer a hosted version for a fee. That means some decisions will be made that don't explicitly make sense for self-hosted but _do_ support the goal of us offering a for-pay hosted version.

## Features

As a personal finance + wealth management app, Maybe has a lot of features. Here's a brief overview of some of the main ones...

-   Net worth tracking
-   Financial account syncing
-   Investment benchmarking
-   Investment portfolio allocation
-   Debt insights
-   Retirement forecasting + planning
-   Investment return simulation
-   Manual account/investment tracking

And dozens upon dozens of smaller features.

## Building the app

This is the current state of building the app. You'll hit errors, which we're working to resolve (and certainly welcome PRs to help with that).

You'll need Docker installed to run the app locally.

First, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, create a new secret using `openssl rand -base64 32` and populate `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in your `.env` file with it.

To enable transactional emails, you'll need to create a [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) account and add your API key to your `.env` file (`NX_POSTMARK_API_TOKEN`). You can also set the from and reply-to email addresses (`NX_POSTMARK_FROM_ADDRESS` and `NX_POSTMARK_REPLY_TO_ADDRESS`). If you want to run the app without email, you can set `NX_POSTMARK_API_TOKEN` to a dummy value.

Maybe uses [Teller](https://teller.io/) for connecting financial accounts. To get started with Teller, you'll need to create an account. Once you've created an account:

-   Add your Teller application id to your `.env` file (`NEXT_PUBLIC_TELLER_APP_ID`).
-   Download your authentication certificates from Teller, create a `certs` folder in the root of the project, and place your certs in that directory. You should have both a `certificate.pem` and `private_key.pem`. **NEVER** check these files into source control, the `.gitignore` file will prevent the `certs/` directory from being added, but please double check.
-   Set your `NEXT_PUBLIC_TELLER_ENV` and `NX_TELLER_ENV` to your desired environment. The default is `sandbox` which allows for testing with mock data. The login credentials for the sandbox environment are `username` and `password`. To connect to real financial accounts, you'll need to use the `development` environment.
-   Webhooks are not implemented yet, but you can populate the `NX_TELLER_SIGNING_SECRET` with the value from your Teller account.
-   We highly recommend checking out the [Teller docs](https://teller.io/docs) for more info.

Then run the following yarn commands:

```
yarn install
yarn run dev:services:all
yarn prisma:migrate:dev
yarn prisma:seed
yarn dev
```

## High-priority issues

The biggest focus at the moment is on getting the app functional without some previously key external services (namely Plaid and Finicity).

You can view the current [high-priority issues here](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22high+priority%22). Those are the most impactful issues to tackle first.

## External data

To pull market data in (for investments), you'll need a Polygon.io API key. You can get one for free [here](https://polygon.io/) and then add it to your `.env` file (`NX_POLYGON_API_KEY`).
